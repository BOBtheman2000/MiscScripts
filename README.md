# MiscScripts
A collection of miscellaneous single scripts and lesser projects.

This is just a big repository for any of my scripts that don't use any additional libraries or environments, and don't have any reason to be individual repos. I'll add new scripts here as I create them.

## chess.py
This is checkers.

Move pieces by entering a row, column, and direction:
- u for up left
- r for up right
- d for down right
- l for down left

For example, to move your up leftmost piece up and to the right, enter: 62r

I'm not adding a clickable gui
